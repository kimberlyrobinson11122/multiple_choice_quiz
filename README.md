# User Story

AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria: 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Name
Kimberly Robinson's Portfolio 

## Deployed Application
[Visit my deployed portfolio](https://kimberlyrobinson11122.github.io/Kimberly-Robinson-Portfolio/)

## Description
This deployment is to showcase the projects and work for potential employers and clients

## Solved
1. We solved the responsive screen issue that was broken in the first build

2. Fixed the project card images to fit and be same sizing

3. Commits do not align as first build was corrupted with conflicting branches, rebuilt commits only show recent work


## Images
Screenshot of the first build:

Screenshot of the project cards as they should be, adjusting to sizing from center to one column when shrinking the screen:

## Credits
This was built from scratch


## Test
Consistent testing of links throughout each iteration
